                1. Shah Rukh Khan
                There are superstars and there is Shah Rukh Khan. Shah Rukh Khan is not just an artist he is a brand on his own. His popularity is not just limited just to India but his name is recognized throughout the globe. And the fact that he has made it big in the industry on his own without any sort of backing is what makes his journey to being King Khan even more special. Shah Rukh Khan started his career with a TV show called Fauji in 1988 and is now said to be second richest actor in the world. Shah Rukh currently earns more than Hollywood bigwigs such as Tom Cruise and Johnny Depp and only falls behind the stand-up comic legend Jerry Seinfeld. His true journey to being the mega star began after Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. The movie attracted cult following and is still running a matinee show at Mumbai’s Maratha Mandir. Every Indian has seen the film multiple times and most of them can even recite the lines from the film. His global appeal does not even come close to any other Indian celebrity. When My Name is Khan was about to be screened at the Berlin Film Festival in 2012, the tickets for the movie were sold out within a mere five minutes.  He was also the third Indian to be honoured with a wax statue at the very popular Madame Tussads Wax Museum. Besides all the work, he is also popular because he is an amazing human being at the end of the day. He might be the biggest star in the country currently but he will never shy from admitting a mistake or criticizing himself. That is why it can be said he is one of the biggest influencers of the country.

                2. Salman Khan
                Even though Salman Khan just turned 52 years he doesn’t look a day older than 30. His chiselled physique can give actors even half his age a run for their money. From a boy next door Prem to the lethal and ruthless Tiger, Salman Khan has sure come a long way in his career. His crazy fans being so attached to him speaks volumes about his success. Right from his debut, Salman has begun making trends. Until Salman entered the industry the physique of an actor wasn’t considered to be extremely important. But his shirtless avatar changed all that. After his debut, not only actors started giving more priority for developing a good physique but Salman also managed to influence the youth of our nation which pushed them to working hard on their body. Even now, whatever Salman Khan does ends up being a trend. Be it a dialogue or hairstyle, a song or something even as basic as a bracelet. It is no surprise that Salman Khan is one of the biggest influencers of the country. Salman also has the reputation for introducing and nurturing fresh talent in the industry. He has introduced many artists in the industry over the years and he also makes sure they are able to get quality work to showcase their talent.

                3. Amitabh Bachchan
                If Shah Rukh Khan is the “King” of Indian cinema Amitabh Bachchan is the “Emperor”. Amitabh Bachchan is probably the first mega star that the country has seen. He literally defines what it means to be a celebrity. And he’s also the gold standard for the industry when it comes to acting. Even after being loved by millions not only in India but the world he still somehow manages to remain grounded and humble. Amitabh Bachchan is probably the only actor in the industry about whom you can talk with your father and even grandfather. Yes! He has been around since that long. And during these decades of work he has never let the ball drop once and has always remained dedicated to his work. Even today at the age of 75 his dedication to movies remains strong as ever. Even his deep baritone is something that people immensely admire about him as he is often seen lending his voice for movies narrations.
